Here are my slides from Day 2 of Barcamp 2018 on "How to avoid Stack Overflows"

Important note: In my talk I was not clear regarding using CPS: Continuation
Passing Style for avoiding stack overflows. They require tail call optimization
in the language runtime like APS: Accumulator Passing Stylle. This is corrected in
the slides.
In addition, there are 2 more methods for what to do if your language does not
support TCO
