# Deep Dive into Continuations and CPS

## What are continuations?

## What is Continuation passing style?

## Continuations via call-with-current-continuation or call/cc

A continuation is simply: the remainder of the work left to be done.

### The sandwich joke

Say you want to make a sandwich. 
1. You go to the fridge
2. Pull 2 slices of bread
3. grab the meat, cheese and any veggies.
4. Get the condiments
5. Assemble the ingrediants
6. Place between the 2 bread slices.
7. Invoke the continuation.
1. Go to the fridge (... all your sandwich fixins have disappeared in a puff of smoke :(




### First class continuations via call/cc or callcc.

One line example.

This code is in Ruby, but the language does not matter.

```
$ irb -W0 -r continuation
>> "Hello #{callcc {|k| $k = k; 'World'}}"
=> "Hello World"
>> 
?> $k
=> #<Continuation:0x007f846e916488>
>> $k.call('Sailor')
=> "Hello Sailor"
>> $k.call('George')
=> "Hello George"
>> $k.call('Gracie')
=> "Hello Gracie"
>> x=$k.call('yourself')
=> "Hello yourself"
>> x
=> nil
```

But we can get the effect we want:

```

>> x = "Hello #{callcc {|k| $k=k; 'World'}}"
=> "Hello World"
>> $k.call('yourself')
=> "Hello yourself"
>> x
=> "Hello yourself"

````


#### First caveat

We cannot use the result of invoking the continuation in further expressions
as illustrated by the first example of "x = $k.call('yourself')"

The reason is these are called Unlimited Continuations. What we need for this
functionality is Delimited Continuations. More on that later.

#### Second caveat: Do NOT type this code into a Ruby file and try to run it.

Why not? Can you guess?


### How does this work?

Let's say you have this canonical expression:

```
# Ruby:

>> 5 + 3 * 4
=> 17

;; Scheme version

> (+ 5 (* 3 4))
17

```

With a continuation:

```
# Ruby

>> 5 + callcc {|k| 3 * 4}
=> 17

;; Scheme:


> (+ 5 (call/cc (lambda (k) (* 3 4))))
17

```

Let's save the continuation in $k:
```
# Ruby:

>> 5 + callcc {|k| $k=k; 3 * 4}
=> 17
>> $k.call(10)
=> 15
>> $k.call(7 - 2)
=> 10
>> 

;;; Scheme:

> (define $k '())
> (+ 5 (call/cc (lambda (k) (set! $k k) (* 3 4))))
17
> $k
#<continuation>
> ($k 10)
15
> ($k (- 7 2))
10

```


### The RPN version

Let's translate the above into postfix notation: (I.e. Reverse Polish Notation:
RPN or H.P. calculator style)
``
5
3
4
*
+

=> 17
```


With a continuation graphically:

```
5
----------
3
4
*
----------
+

=> 17
```


The continuation is everything above and below the dashed lines:

This is what the 'k' continuation captures:

```
5
_
+
```

The '_' above is the hole  into which we will plug the the parameter we pass to
the call to 'k.call( _ )'





### Actual use case: Exceptions

We can apply continuations to the case of implementing an exception handler.

Here is an example of a simple handler for a safe_fread function in Vish:

```
# safe_fread.vs - safe version of fread using continuations for exceptions
defn safe_fread(fname) {
  # guard exception handlers
  nofile=except("No such file: %{:fname}")
    noread=except("Cannot read file: %{:fname}")
  result=callcc(->(k) {
    fexist?(:fname) || k(nofile(callcc(->(cc) {:cc})))
    freadable?(:fname) || k(noread(callcc(->(cc) {:cc})))
    fread(:fname)
  })
  :result
}
```
