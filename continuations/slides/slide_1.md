Say you want to make a sandwich. 
1. You go to the fridge
2. Pull 2 slices of bread
3. grab the meat, cheese and any veggies.
4. Get the condiments
5. Assemble the ingrediants
6. Place between the 2 bread slices.
7. Invoke the continuation.
1. Go to the fridge (... all your sandwich fixins have disappeared in a puff of smoke :(
